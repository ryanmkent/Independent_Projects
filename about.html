                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Hello, I'm Candy Lai and I'm a 3D artist specializing mostly on technical skills like character rigging, texturing, lighting, compositing, and among others. With my current expertise in 3D software I also believe that I can serve as part of a 3D motion graphics team.
     
    I've always found the world of VFX fascinating and how computer artists can create the illusory images we see on the screens of theaters and televisions. That being said, I hold a great interest in mastering such skills to create the impossible possible in the form of CGI films. In other words, I'm highly interested in techniques such as 3D dynamic simulations, camera tracking, 3D lighting and texturing, rendering to "fool" the audiences into thinking how CG elements can completely interact with the real world. As far-fetched as it sounds, I aspire to work for feature film as a CG artist and be part of the pipeline as (preferably) a compositor.</p>
